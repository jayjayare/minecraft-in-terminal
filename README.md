This project is a fork from  Shubhkarman-Singh-Sandhu's Blog Project. Specifically the minecraft in terminal which i have ported to linux.

Currently it is set to screen 1 which is easily configured in the main.py

Further information should be resorted to the original creators post; all i have done is edit the code to be compatible with linux.
